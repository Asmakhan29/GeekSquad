          <p className="px-5">
            We provide an online forum for Provider Members to list information about themselves and their tutoring services and for Student Members to find tutors and view information about their services. We do not endorse, hire or employ the Provider Members nor are we responsible or liable for any interactions involved between Provider Members and their respective Student Members or between Members. Provider Members and Student Members are solely responsible for all interactions, conversations, and any form of communication and behavior between any other Member, including scheduling lessons and paying for lessons. Our Services are separate and distinct from the services of Provider Members.

            Prices for lessons are set solely between the Provider Member and the Student Member. We have no role or responsibility in setting prices, charging any fees, collecting any fees or providing any refunds. All such matters are handled directly between the Provider Member and the Student Member.

            We reserve the right to restrict any Services only to Members and discontinue any product or Services at will. If a particular Provider, product or Service is discontinued or unavailable, we reserve the right to provide substitute Provider, product or Service.

            We may rank and/or order provider search results. For more information about our search result ranking criteria please visit our Explanation of Ranking Parameters page.

          <p className="px-5">
            You and TakeLessons IN each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and TakeLessons IN relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of the Terms of Use, your use of or access to TakeLessons IN's Services, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through TakeLessons IN shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
          </p>
          <div className="container px-5">
            <p className='px-3'><span className="fw-bold">1. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.</span> YOU AND TAKELESSONS IN AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND TAKELESSONS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.</p>

            <p className="px-3"><span className="fw-bold">2. Arbitration Procedures.</span> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as prohibited by law.</p>

            <p className="px-3">The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ( <span className="fw-bold">"AAA"</span> ) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word "arbitrator" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration: rather, the AAA's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>

            <p className="px-3">A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, written Notice of Dispute ( <span className="fw-bold">"Notice"</span> ). The Notice must include a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought. The Notice to TakeLessons IN should be sent to TakeLessons, Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, (Microsoft Corporation) One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399. TakeLessons IN will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your TakeLessons IN account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date.</p>

            <p className="px-3">If you and TakeLessons IN are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or TakeLessons IN may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to TakeLessons IN at the following address: TakeLessons do Incorp Services, Inc., 5716 Corsa Avenue, Suite 110, Westlake Village, CA 91362. In the event TakeLessons IN initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your TakeLessons IN account. Any settlement offer made by you or TakeLessons IN shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>

            <p className="px-3">If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or TakeLessons IN may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and TakeLessons IN subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or TakeLessons IN may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>

            <p className="px-3">The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same TakeLessons IN user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

            <p className="px-3"><span className="fw-bold">3. Costs of Arbitration.</span> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, TakeLessons IN will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by TakeLessons IN should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and TakeLessons IN will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse TakeLessons IN for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by TakeLessons IN on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>

            <p className="px-3"><span className="fw-bold">4. Severability.</span> With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ( <span className="fw-bold">"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"</span> ), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ( <span className="fw-bold">"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"</span> ) is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement will continue to apply.</p>

            <p className="px-3"><span className="fw-bold">5. Opt-Out Procedure.</span> IF YOU ARE A NEW TAKELESSONS USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ( <span className="fw-bold">"OPT-OUT"</span> ) BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE ( <span className="fw-bold">"OPT-OUT NOTICE"</span> ). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE USER AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO TAKELESSONS, ATTN: LITIGATION DEPARTMENT, RE: OPT-OUT NOTICE, Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Opt Out Notice, (Microsoft Corporation) One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399. You must complete the Opt-Out Notice by providing your name, address (including street address, city, state and zip code), and the user ID(s) and email address(es) associated with the TakeLessons IN account(s) to which the opt-out applies and state that you wish to Opt Out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the Agreement and this Section will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.</p>

            <p className="px-3"><span className="fw-bold">6. Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate.</span> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against TakeLessons IN prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and TakeLessons IN. We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on the Website or within our Services at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your account within the 30 day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.</p>
